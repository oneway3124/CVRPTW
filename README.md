# MVRP-Gurobi
This code is written in Python-Gurobi API interface.
This is a capacitated multiple vehicle routing problem.
This code also has time windows constraint.

We can levitate the time windows constraint if only solving the capacitated problem.

Or we can levitate the capacity constraint if only dealing with time windows with unlimited vehicle capacity.

Either of those constraints are capable of eliminating subtours.

The CSV file with 400 nodes has (x,y) coordinates of depot and customer nodes, demand at customer node and profit.

The CSV file with only 10 nodes is to test time windows. It has earliet start time, latest start time and service duration. Travelling time from one node to other is to determined from distance from one node to other.

对比gurobi实现MTSP问题，以及约束问题，实际能很好地运行起来。
